<h1>About Midnight Cheese</h1>
<p>Midnight Cheese is a hodgepodge of design and technology related musings going all the way back to 2001. That's roughly 89 years ago in internet time. Lately I've been delving deeper into the scripting side of things from Arduino to the latest (mostly JS related) web trends. My intent is to use this space to share what I learn along the way.</p>
<p>
  I've been working in the Design profession for 10 years spending the majority of my time on front-end web development. I'm currently a Product Manager with
  <a href="http://myemma.com/">Emma</a>
  focusing on their new web based email creation tools. Previously I worked at
  <a href="http://tapeonline.com/">TapeOnline.com</a>
  and have worked on a wide range of freelance projects doing everything from illustration to motion graphics work.

<p>
  A few of my favorite projects that I've crafted over the years include <a href="http://candorgallery.com/">Candor Gallery</a> and <a href="http://hamweekly.com/">Amateur Radio Weekly</a>.
